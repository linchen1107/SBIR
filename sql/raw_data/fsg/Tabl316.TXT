58|A|Note-Excludes oscillator items which should be classified in FSC 5955 or 5963; fiber optic items which should be classified in Group 60; electronic modules as defined under Class 5963; and electrical cable, cord and wire assemblies, harnesses and sets, related to FSG 58 equipment (see FSC 5995). In Group 58, more than in any other group, it frequently happens that the same name is listed as an index entry in each of several classes. In addition, that name may also appear as an entry in groups other than 58. Each such entry refers to a distinctly different part or assembly, even though the different items have the same name. The listing of the same names in two or more classes indicates that, in one form, the part or assembly covered by the name is applicable to the equipment covered by one class, and in another form is applicable to the equipment covered by another class. For example, the item name CODER, AUDIO FREQUENCY is applicable to two distinctly different assemblies, one of which has an application in cryptologic equipment, covered by Class 5810, and the other in radar equipment covered by Class 5840. Consequently the name CODER, AUDIO FREQUENCY is an entry under each of the two classes.  When an item identification bears a name which is indexed under more than one class of Group 58, or in Group 58 and in some other group, the item will be classified in the same class as its next higher assembly in the manner described in the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Procedures Manual, DoD 4100.39-M.  Also excluded from this group are data transmission and communications equipment such as terminals, sensors and other devices designed for use with a configuration of ADPE.|Communication, Detection, and Coherent Radiation Equipment|2004019|
59|A|Note-Mounting hardware, included in classes of this group, includes such specially designed items as brackets, holders, retainers, etc. Excluded from classes in this group are such hardware items as screws (Class 5305), bolts (Class 5306), studs (Class 5307), washers (Class 5310), rivets (Class 5320), and other common items indexed to specific classes, other than in Group 59. The FSC indexes and structure will govern the classification of items used on or with mounting hardware cited above.|Electrical and Electronic Equipment Components|1974091|
60|A|Note- Fiber Optics is a general term used to describe the function where optical energy (i.e., light/laser driven rays) is guided to another location through fiber(s). This group includes Fiber Optic items such as parts, materials and devices used for communications, data transmission, or illumination, Excludes Imaging devices under FSG 65 (medical); hand tools under FSG 51; and electrical, electronic and optical instruments under FSG 66 (instruments).|Fiber Optics Materials, Components, Assemblies, and Accessories|1979298|

68|A|Note-In general, individual nonmedicinal chemical elements and compounds are classified in Class 6810. Combinations (or mixtures) of chemical compounds, or chemicals prepared in a particular vehicle (other than water) are generally classified according to use, in classes other than 6810. For example, the chemical compound DDT, is classified in 6810, whereas DDT liquid spray, the insecticide, is classified in 6840-Pest Control Agents and Disinfectants. Similarly items of supply bearing nonchemical names such as BLEACH; INSECTICIDE, ROACH; and ANTIFREEZE are generally classified according to use, in classes other than 6810, whereas corresponding chemical compounds, such as sodium hypochlorite solution, chlordane, and ethylene glycol are classified in 6810. Medicinal chemicals are generally classified in 6505-Drugs and Biologicals; in vitro diagnostic substances and reagents are classified in 6550-In Vitro Diagnostic Substances, Reagents, Test Kits and Sets. Excluded from this group are liquid chemicals designed exclusively for use as propellant fuels and oxidizers.|Chemicals and Chemical Products|1974091|

However, when the chest, case, box, roll, bag, or other container is primarily a shipping container, it is classified in Group 81.|Containers, Packaging, and Packing Supplies|1974091|
