34|08|A|||Note-The following definitions apply to "Machining Centers" and "Way-type Machines".  a. "Machining Center", refers to a multipurpose numerically controlled machine tool for the complete and automatic machining of parts requiring multiple operations such as milling, drilling, tapping, boring, and reaming, having an integral tool storage device and an integral means for positioning various faces of the work piece. It must have facilities for automatic interchanging of varied cutting tools between successive operations. Excluded from this class are multipurpose numerically controlled machine tools, such as Boring-Drilling-Milling Machines, which require the use of an attachment or accessory for tool storage and/or to position the various faces of a work piece. These types of equipment are classified in other appropriate classes within group 34.  b. "Way-type Machine", refers to a special machine tool of station type design consisting of individually mounted self-contained machining units and facilities for indexing the work piece to each station in a predetermined sequence. The machining unit(s) may be disassembled and rearranged to accommodate different work piece configurations. Machine is capable of performing single or multiple operations on the work piece simultaneously or in sequence to each station.|Machining Centers and Way-Type Machines|1974091|

Washers are a perforated piece of metal, leather, or other materials of various shapes or forms. They are used primarily as a seat for a bolt, nut, screw, rivet or nail to distribute pressure and prevent endwise motion over an area and/or to prevent movement between two parts by means of restraining features created by the shape of its edges.|Nuts and Washers|1995240|

A bushing is cylindrical in shape, hollow, and designed primarily to be inserted into a hole to reduce the effective inside diameter of the hole, and to protect the body structure about the hole from damage resulting from stress, strain, and vibration. b. A ring is cylindrical in shape, usually flat with a center hole. Rings are multi-applicational. See specific item name for designated usage. c.

Frequently referred to as an Information Technology (IT) or Automated Data Processing (ADP) system, although the term "system" is not considered definitive. Includes an assembly of devices consisting of a central processing unit (CPU) and the necessary input/output devices, accessorial devices, analog measurement devices, software and/or firmware required to perform the desired objectives.
